        <h2>📜 Ambition</h2>
        <p>
          Graduate student majoring in Software Engineering at Northeastern University in the beautiful city of Boston. 
          Skilled in MERN Stack. I have a strong grip on Java and C/C++, and have dabbled with several backend frameworks whenever the need arose. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Completing internships at two different firms with various job roles and responsibilities and a couple of personal projects has enabled me to arrive at these diversified sets of skills.
          I have a stronger inclination towards software development and am familiar with API Automation, UI Automation, Unix Programming & all SDET Fundamentals and wasn't shy to try out new tools that seemed cool along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          I plan to choose the fullstack career after my graduation and therefore a co-op in a software engineering sector would prove to be very useful to gain industrial exposure, learn new technologies and enhance my current skillset.
